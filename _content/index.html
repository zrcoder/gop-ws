    <a>For engineering</a>
    <p>
        Go+ has rich engineering tools and powerful engineering management capabilities,
        fully compatible with Go, both in terms of syntax and engineering capabilities.
    </p>
</div>
<div>
    <a>For STEM education</a>
    <p>
        Go+ is a static typed language, but has a script-like style, you can even use Go+ programs as shell scripts.
        It has a very low threshold and is suitable for elementary and middle school students to learn programming.
    </p>
</div>
<div>
    <a>For data science</a>
    <p>
        Not only script-like syntax, Go+ also supports many features for data science,
        such as list comprehension, rational numbers, operator overloading, etc. Go+ has more readable code for data science than Go.
